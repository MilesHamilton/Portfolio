          I've always been <strong> tickering </strong>, tearing things
          apart,and building them anew. modifying them to make something and
          exciting. As a child, I enjoyed figuring out how things worked from
          gaming consoles like my N64 to my very first computer. In high school
          i was fascinated with virtual machines, booting up operating systems i
          had litte knowledge of for fun.

          After highschool I enlisted in the Ohio Army Nation Guard to pay for
          school. While serving I ended up learning alot of different niche
          <strong> skills and expertise</strong> along the way. My deployment to
          kuwait brought on a lot of challenges, but came with it the oppurtity
          to learn and grow.

          Motivated by my exposure to surveying technologies and operations I
          pursued and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in
          <strong> Geology</strong> and found my passion in research based work

          Working as a <strong>research scientist </strong> for the past two
          years, learning all that I could, I was suddenly faced with my own
          existential crisis. in-adversity. I yearned for the child like
          passions and creativity I found that had brought me so much joy as a
          kid.

          <strong> solutions</strong> can i solve for you?
